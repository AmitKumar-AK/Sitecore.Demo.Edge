        <p>Our history is rich and we&rsquo;re proud to celebrate 50 years running.&nbsp;The rise and fall of the great US running movement has been a roller coaster of emotions, and in the end, there were no easy choices. You&rsquo;ll remember the highs and lows of the past, but you&rsquo;ll also know that we put our heart and soul into every run, every day, and every year. We&rsquo;ve been involved in running since 1971, and we&rsquo;ve been passionate about running since the day we picked up the first running shoes.</p>
